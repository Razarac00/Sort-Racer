# Sort-Racer
IDK I just wanted to compare sorting algorithms

The plan:
1. Implement various sorting algorithms [list of int] -> [sorted list of int] in C or Python or something.
2. Write a script to run these algorithms against the legit ones already in place.
3. Display results on a nice plotted line graph(s).
4. Get a job lol.
